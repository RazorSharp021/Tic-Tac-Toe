# Tic Tac Toe : [Click to Play](https://razorsharp021.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe/)


The game is played between two players where each player gets to select a box per turn. Any player who successfully selects three boxes in a row (on any direction) wins the game.
If neither of the players can do this, the game will be a draw.

### Approach to problem

1. First of all, we need to create the game board, 3 rows and 3 columns
2. create a main container and put the boxes insideinside the board
3. give each box a unique **ID**
4. We have two players, so we create ( **'X'** and **'O'** ) to toggle between the two
5. Each player gets to choose an empty slot per turn it has to be an empty available box only...

6. **Game Logic:** if there is no winner (No consecutive 3 boxes selected by any players) result is draw.
If there is a winner, it will be announced, and the winner gets a score.
