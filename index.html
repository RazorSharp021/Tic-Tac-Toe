<!-- TIC TAC TOE -->

<!-- first we need the game board,which can be made of 9 collective boxes, possibly divided into three vertical columns and three horizental rows. -->

<!-- Each box would be given a unique ID so it can be accessed easily through querySelector. -->

<!-- Each player gets to choose an empty slot per turn, which has to be an empty available box only...

Players are to be asked to make a valid choice when click the wrong slot (e.g. an already selected one)

The players choice is to be toggled between 'X' and 'O' after each valid choice, for the next player to play the game. -->
